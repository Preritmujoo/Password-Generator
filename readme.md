# Password Generator

A simple and visually appealing Password Generator web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides users with the ability to generate passwords based on their preferences and includes `light` or `dark` theme switching for an enhanced user experience.

## Features

- **Four Types of Passwords**:

  1. **Strong Password**: Contains uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) characters.
  2. **Weak Password**: Contains only lowercase (a-z) characters.
  3. **Super Strong Password**: Contains uppercase (A-Z), lowercase (a-z), and special characters.
  4. **Funny Password**: Contains simple, funny keywords like *charger*, *admin*, *coffee*, *handpump*, etc.

- **User-defined Character Length**: The number of characters in the password is set by the user.

- **Theme Switching**: Toggle between `light` and `dark` themes for a personalized appearance.

- **Dynamic Password Generation**:

  - A ```Generate Again``` button to create new passwords of the same type and length.
  - Easily switch between different password types while retaining the selected character length.
  - A `Copy` button for convenient copying of the generated password.

- **Reload Button**: Refresh the page to start with different settings or create a new password type.
